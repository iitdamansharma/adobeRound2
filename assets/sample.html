    <h1>Sample Document for PDF Reader</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a sample document to test the PDF Reader application developed for the Adobe India Hackathon Round 2 challenge. The document contains various headings and sections to demonstrate the outline extraction functionality.</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
    <p>The Adobe India Hackathon "Connecting the Dots" Challenge focuses on reimagining the PDF experience. Round 1 involved extracting structured outlines from PDFs, while Round 2 builds on that by creating an intuitive reading webapp using Adobe's PDF Embed API.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The challenge is to build a beautiful, intuitive reading webapp using Adobe's PDF Embed API, leveraging the Round 1 work to design a futuristic webapp that enhances the PDF reading experience.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
    <p>Our approach involves creating a responsive web application that integrates Adobe's PDF Embed API with the document structure extraction from Round 1.</p>
    
    <h3>2.1 Data Collection</h3>
    <p>We collect document structure data by processing PDFs and extracting their outline, including title and headings (H1, H2, H3) with corresponding page numbers.</p>
    
    <h3>2.2 Analysis Techniques</h3>
    <p>We analyze the document structure to create a navigable outline that enhances the reading experience.</p>
    
    <h4>2.2.1 Quantitative Analysis</h4>
    <p>This involves measuring the effectiveness of the navigation system and user interaction patterns.</p>
    
    <h4>2.2.2 Qualitative Analysis</h4>
    <p>This focuses on user experience and the intuitiveness of the interface design.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Results</h2>
    <p>The resulting application provides an enhanced PDF reading experience with intuitive navigation and interactive features.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1 Key Findings</h3>
    <p>Users can navigate complex documents more efficiently using the extracted outline structure.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Interpretation</h3>
    <p>The integration of document structure with the PDF viewer creates a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
    <p>The application demonstrates how PDF documents can be transformed from static files into interactive, navigable content.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By combining Adobe's PDF Embed API with document structure extraction, we've created a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with PDF documents.</p>
